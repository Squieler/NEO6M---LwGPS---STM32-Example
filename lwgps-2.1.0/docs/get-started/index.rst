* Run ``git pull origin master --recurse-submodules`` command to pull latest changes and to fetch latest changes from submodules
* Run ``git submodule foreach git pull origin master`` to update & merge all submodules

.. note::
	This is preferred option to use when you want to evaluate library and run prepared examples.
	Repository consists of multiple submodules which can be automatically downloaded when cloning and pulling changes from root repository.

Add library to project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point it is assumed that you have successfully download library, either cloned it or from releases page.

* Copy ``lwgps`` folder to your project
* Add ``lwgps/src/include`` folder to `include path` of your toolchain
* Add source files from ``lwgps/src/`` folder to toolchain build
* Copy ``lwgps/src/include/lwgps/lwgps_opts_template.h`` to project folder and rename it to ``lwgps_opts.h``
* Build the project

Configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Library comes with template config file, which can be modified according to needs.
This file shall be named ``lwgps_opts.h`` and its default template looks like the one below.

.. note::
    Default configuration template file location: ``lwgps/src/include/lwgps/lwgps_opts_template.h``.
    File must be renamed to ``lwgps_opts.h`` first and then copied to the project directory (or simply renamed in-place) where compiler
    include paths have access to it by using ``#include "lwgps_opts.h"``.

.. tip::
    Check :ref:`api_lwgps_opt` section for possible configuration settings
